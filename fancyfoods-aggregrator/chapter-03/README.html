<h1>Chapter 3</h1><p>
This source code demonstrates using JPA persistence to read and write from a database, and using JTA transactions to cleanly handle any failures.
</p>

<p>The build scripts and instructions assume you have already run the chapter 2 samples.</p>


<h2>Using JPA Persistence to Populate Special Offers from a Database</h2>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>mvn install</code> in the <code>chapter-03</code> directory to build the fancyfoods bundles.</li>
<li>If they're not already there, copy the <code>fancyfoods.api</code>, <code>fancyfoods.web</code>, </code><code>fancyfoods.business</code>, and <code>fancyfoods.department.chocolate</code> bundles to the <code>blog-assembly/load</code> directory from <code>target</code></li>
<li>Copy the <code>fancyfoods.datasource</code>, <code>fancyfoods.persistence</code>, and <code>fancyfoods.department.cheese</code> bundles to the <code>blog-assembly/load</code> directory from <code>target</code></li>
<li>Run
<code>java -jar org.eclipse.osgi-3.7.0.v20110613.jar -console</code> from the <code>blog-assembly/load</code> directory
</li>
<li>Have a look at <a href="http://localhost:8080/fancyfoods.web/SayHelloJNDI">http://localhost:8080/fancyfoods.web/SayHelloJNDI</a>. There should be two special offers, and the page should say <pre>Hello valued customer!
Normal chocolates	6.99	A wonderful surprise for someone you want to impress.
Wensleydale cheese	1.81	A wonderful surprise for someone cheesy.</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Using JPA Persistence to Write To A Database</h2>

<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/fancyfoods.web/SayHelloShopping">http://localhost:8080/fancyfoods.web/SayHelloShopping</a>. You should see the same chocolate and cheese offers, but with hyperlinks.
<li>Click on the cheese link and buy two packs of Wensleydale. You should see a message like
<pre>
Holly is a new customer.
There were 15 packs of Wensleydale cheese in stock.
Holly tried to buy 2 packs of Wensleydale cheese
Afterwards, Holly had a balance of -£3.62 and a credit limit of -£20.0
And after? There were 13 packs of Wensleydale cheese in stock.</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Preserving Transactional Integrity with JTA</h2>

<ol>
<li>Revisit <a href="http://localhost:8080/fancyfoods.web/SayHelloShopping">http://localhost:8080/fancyfoods.web/SayHelloShopping</a>. 
</li>
<li>Try and buy three boxes of chocolates instead. This will exceed your default
credit limit, and the transaction should fail.
You should see a transaction rollback exception in the console, and the stock
level of the chocolates should stay unchanged. The web page should say
<pre>
Holly had a balance of -£3.62 and a credit limit of -£20.0
There were 8 packs of Normal chocolates in stock.
Holly tried to buy 3 packs of Normal chocolates
A problem happened: £20.0 is not enough credit for a £24.59 purchase.
And after? There were 8 packs of Normal chocolates in stock.</pre>
</li>
</ol>
